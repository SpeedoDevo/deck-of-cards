# Deck of Cards

## User Story - Deck of Cards Summary

As a magician, I'd like to shuffle, draw and sort cards so that I can perform magic tricks

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Can I shuffle the deck of cards?
2. Can I draw any given number of cards from the deck, with the cards being removed from the original deck?
3. Can I draw any given number of cards from the deck and then sort the drawn cards, with the cards being removed from the original deck?
4. Sorted cards are sorted by suit: Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds; then by value: Ace is high.

## Back of card (Technical Constraints):

1. A simple User Interface is fine – though we’d love to see what you’re capable of! Use an appropriate language/framework for the job role that you are applying for.
2. If you are applying for a Interactive Development role then we expect that you write a web application. However, if you are purely a serverside developer, we will accept the application running from the terminal, as well as from tests.
3. With the exception of testing, minimise the use of external frameworks.
4. Use best in industry engineering practices.
5. Ensure that your code is well tested.

## Guidance

- Please provide us with build/test/run instructions as well as the codebase, preferably via github.
- We wouldn't ask anyone to do a coding puzzle that we haven't done ourselves, so the people looking at your code understand the problem we're asking to be solved.
- It took us around 3 hours to do this, so please use this as an indicator of effort required. We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.
- As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time
- Do you test drive your code? This is something we value.
- We want to see that you are familiar and able to create a build process for your code that means it is easy to build, test and run.
- Bonus points are given to those who spend time ensuring there code is continuously analysed by appropriate build tooling to ensure code quality.
- We also consider the extensibility of the code produced. Well-factored code should be relatively easily extended. Any indicator of design (DDD, or design patterns) would make us smile, as well as BDD and TDD approaches to development.

Thanks and good luck.
